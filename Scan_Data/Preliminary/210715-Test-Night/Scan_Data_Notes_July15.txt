2050:
Aborted due to vertical overshoot, set the top angle to 0, not good data

2055:
Aborted due to vertical overshoot, motor seemed to fail to move sufficiently downward to 150 deg.

2135:
Let run through, but same issue arose, where motor was not moving sufficiently down. Large distortions can be seen near
the end of the scan that show this behavior.

2155:
Set steppers to DOUBLE instead of SINGLE. Scan was much more consistent with the extra torque driving the motor. However,
the backlash issue still remains. This should 100% be the target of intensive analysis.
